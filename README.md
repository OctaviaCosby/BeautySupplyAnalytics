# Beauty Supply Analytics
### Introduction
In this repository I help a Local beauty supply shop gain insights on their data through cleaning and tidying then through various forms of analysis like linear regression, basket analysis, data visualizations, competitive analysis, time series analysis and written business strategies. In the dataset I was able to analyze customer purchase behavior using transactional data and gain imperative knowledge on markeing, inventory and operational decisions for this beauty supply store.
